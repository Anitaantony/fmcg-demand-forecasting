# FMCG Demand Forecasting and Smart Inventory Optimization System

## Domain
Retail / Business Analytics

## Project Description
Inventory management in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector is a complex task due to high sales volume, frequent demand fluctuations, and limited product shelf life. Many small and medium-scale retailers still depend on manual forecasting methods or fixed reorder rules, which often lead to stock shortages, excess inventory, and increased operational costs.

This project presents an Intelligent Demand Forecasting and Smart Inventory Optimization System for FMCG products using machine learning techniques. The system categorizes products into major FMCG groups such as Food & Beverages, Personal Care, Household Care, and Health & Hygiene. Daily sales transactions are collected and stored in a centralized database for analysis.

Historical sales data is preprocessed and transformed into a time-series format to identify trends, seasonality, and consumption patterns. Machine learning models are applied to predict future demand for individual products over a defined time horizon. Based on the predicted demand, the system calculates optimal reorder quantities, safety stock levels, and generates reorder alerts by considering current inventory levels.

An interactive dashboard provides real-time visibility into inventory status, demand forecasts, and recommended actions, enabling store managers to make informed procurement decisions. By integrating demand forecasting and inventory optimization into a single platform, the system helps reduce inventory losses, improve product availability, and enhance overall operational efficiency. The proposed solution is scalable, practical, and suitable for FMCG retailers adopting data-driven inventory management practices.
